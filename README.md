# supPlant-ECE-218

## Project By: James Gaskell, Asher Zive, Daniel Pacheco

## Outline

This project tackles the challenge of caring for a plant whilst on vacation and helps people that are not good at caring for plants (often forgetting to water them or providing bad lighting conditions) to keep their plants alive through automation. In an ideal scenario the user can set the system up by selecting their plant type and leave the system running for an extended period of time without requiring attention or input. 

The system will water the plant when the soil is dry based on a watering schedule unique to the plant, and will provide light to the plant if the room is dark and the plant has not recieved enough light in the day.

The user can troubleshoot using the serial monitor where an arry of measurements and events will be be shown to the user upon pressing the respective button. The user can manually water and provide light to the plant and will also aci=tivate the automation feature by pressing 'S' (indicating Start).
